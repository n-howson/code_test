# Code Test

This is a code test that demonstrates my level of expertise and coding style.

It does not include all elements of the full stack developer test, and has been completed as a Shiny Dashboard rather than React as that is what I am more comfortable with. I have interpreted some of the requirements differently as a result of this.

The dashboard will soon be deployed at shinyapps.io, a link will be provided here when that occurs.
